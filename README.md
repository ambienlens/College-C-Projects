# **C COLLEGE ASSIGNMENT FILES**

### **IDEA**:
This repository contains all the C files I learnt and made during the first and second year at my college **ACADEMY OF TECHNOLOGY** and I am giving away the files in case you get any kind of special information from them.

### **READING THE FILES**:

The files are arranged in Assignment order, and each assignment contains one folder each. Now you can visit each assingment and read the questions.txt there and then you can find the program corresponding to it's question number
